<p>This unique non-rom com comedy series felt so real and relatable to an inch. It's crazy how it lands as one of my top 3 series of all time. Although, it was worth watching all through the 5 seasons. With a lot of scenes tackling some of the cringe/uncomfortable topics society doesn't like to address, i honestly think it was awesome. Aye Cash and the whole cast was spot on to say the least.</p>
<h3>The Blacklist</h3>

<p>James Spader who plays the most wanted criminal Raymond Reddington in this hit series put to tears one too many times, but mostly when Dembe narrated how he left little to fate and would rather die on his own terms. Most times, his quotes led to me think hard and consider a lot when it comes to my real life situations. I definitely think anyone in search of a series should put this one on the list. </p>
<h3>The Bold Type</h3>

<p>Nothing quite reignited my desire to strive for better in life like this series. The three girls, Kat, Sutton and Jane really made me believe that with just a little push we can always get what we want. More than anything i was absolutely in love with Sutton and Richard's relationship. Even though it had ups and downs, it really pulled through. They really made it work. Kat on the other hand made me feel like i can always be courageous in my approach to life. Consequences be damned! </p>
<h3>The Originals</h3>

<P>What's a list without a vampire series? The Originals, a Vampire Diaries spinoff takes on the lives of the Original Vampire family, The Mikaelsons. I'll speak to the end of the series. Elijah- the noble stag- who has always strived to seek for his brother's reedemption, Niklaus, finally redefines what Always and Forever means. When Niklaus decides to take his own life in attempts to save his only child Hope, Elijah sacrifices himself too. His readiness to die side by side with Klaus really brought me down with tears. Their brotherhood and vow to family above everything would be seen as toxic but to me Family is all we got and they stuck by each other till death did them part. What an ending!

Yeap!That's me!
