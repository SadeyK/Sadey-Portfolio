<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm Sadey Kamochu, a wild at heart spirit with a chatty personality.
I'm the unpaid therapist among my friends. I like to think, i would make a great psychologist. It helps to be able to understand people around you and have emotional intelligence.
More than anything, i love music. I basically listen to all genres and they technically speak to all my personalities. </p>

<p>
  I can't quite lie that i've always been interested in tech, but i love a challenge and my curiosity always gets the best of me. I couldn't shake it!
So i went on to Udemy and bought a course without too much thought, only that i wanted to change course. I reached out to a friend who has been in the industry and quite the genius. She gave me some advice and so far besides my curiosity, her advice has kept me going. </p>

<p>I've said quite much-verbal diarrhoea, now i'd like my work to do the talking.</p>
